# Fam SDK Ideas

### Match history
List of recent matches, winner/loser, decks, etc...

### Connect with players you faced recently
Go through all of the logged-in player's recent matches and search if a Fam user exists for the opponent or 2v2 teammate. If one exists, show the profile so they can connect / message that user

### Popular decks
Showcase new, interesting, and high win-rate decks. Graph win rate over time

### Win rate vs decks/cards
Track your win rate againsts certain cards and decks to figure out what you should swap into your deck to counter them

### Random deck generator
Generate a random deck. Probably should be a viable one, but maybe have an option to be completely random.

### Card win rates
Graph card win rates over time
